Other people that are nearby will receive a notification about it. Hopefully someone will react to the signal and help the animal.";

"Q3" = "How does the status of the signal change?";
"A3" = "When a signal is submitted it starts with status 'Help needed'. When somebody decides to answer the signal he/she changes the status to 'Somebody on the way' so that other people know. If for example the person arrives at the place but needs some assistance the status can be changed back to 'Help needed'. When the animal finally receives the needed help the signal is marked as 'Solved'. Signals are color-coded in red, orange and green according to their status.";
